# Hello! 
The following is a front end for improving the website [here.](https://schedules.oval.ucalgary.ca/MobileOpenGymTimes.aspx)

## Motivation
My motivation for making is this project is that I found that looking for when floor hockey was going on at the gym was too cumbersome on the university website. Then I noticed while looking at the raw html of the Univeristy gym website that I could scrape the information and make something better.

Personal recomendation is to try out floor or ice hockey. It is my favourite activity by far and here is my favourite kind of goal called the mishigan.

Happy coding! And make sure to drink water. Anyone is welcome to use this if it helps them!

## My Process
Initially, I sketched up a sample front end that would do the job. My thinking was to get something that was functional and then I could add fancier features later.

Next I defined 3 mini parts in this design.
1. Search rectangle
2. Button pair of expand all and collaspe all.
3. All the cards with info!

After a little bit of work I got something that is pictured below. Functionality with the buttons were not there except the card expanding on click. I felt like I would take time trying to perfect this when I needed to focous on how I wished to store the data.
