# Hello! 
The following is a front end for improving the website [here.](https://schedules.oval.ucalgary.ca/MobileOpenGymTimes.aspx)

A video link for the project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/2ereNpCA3zM)

## Motivation
My motivation for making is this project is that I found that looking for when floor hockey was going on at the gym was too cumbersome on the university website. Then I noticed while looking at the raw html of the Univeristy gym website that I could scrape the information and make something better.

Personal recomendation is to try out floor or ice hockey. It is my favourite activity by far and here is my favourite kind of goal called the mishigan.

Happy coding! And make sure to drink water. Anyone is welcome to use this if it helps them!

## My Process
Initially, I sketched up a sample front end that would do the job. My thinking was to get something that was functional and then I could add fancier features later. After I got that functioning, I began to look at how to connect flask to my react website. Once connected, I made some dummy data to format the JSON how I wanted it to be.

Next, I made a scraper and followed the format of my dummy data that worked.

Lastly, I finalized styling to have a feel that I was pleased with.

## Notes
If I were to work on this furtherly, I would look into how to add advance search features like day. Since I just wanted to get introduced to adding a backend to my front end projects I will leave the project here for now.
