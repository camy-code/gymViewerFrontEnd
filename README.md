# Hello! 
The following is a front end for improving the website [here.](https://schedules.oval.ucalgary.ca/MobileOpenGymTimes.aspx)

## Motivation
My motivation for making is this project is that I found that looking for when floor hockey was going on at the gym was too cumbersome on the university website. Then I noticed while looking at the raw html of the Univeristy gym website that I could scrape the information and make something better.

Personal recomendation is to try out floor or ice hockey. It is my favourite activity by far and here is my favourite kind of goal called the mishigan.
